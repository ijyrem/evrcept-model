##  EVRCEPT: Extracellular Vesicles Enrichment of RNA Cargo Prediction Tool
This tool allows the prediction of the enrichment of RNAs in EVs based on its seqeunce features.

The tool uses a machine learning model trained on RNA sequences to predict whether an RNA is likely to be enriched in extracellular vesicles (EVs) or retained in cells. The tool also provides detailed features extracted from the RNA sequence, including length, GC and, AT percentages, secondary structure features, and nucleotide frequencies as well as RNA binding protein (RBP) motifs.
